 Hi everyone, I'm Osamudiame Ruth Igbinoba and I'm a frontend developer with a year's worth of experience. I enjoy implementing user interface designs using languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.js.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any interesting and challenging project that comes my way. I'm also actively seeking entry-level frontend developer roles in companies where I can build my skills as a developer and contribute to innovative projects that are impactful to the society
